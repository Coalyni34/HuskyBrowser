# HuskyBrowser
## English
Hi, I'm Coalyni34. I'm just amateur programmer and coding is my hobby. So, you can use my code as you wish.

Husky Browser is a free-license software. It has made by WinForms and C#. This programm has regular updates, but at the moment development of it doesn't ended.
You can use programm releases, which made by me. But you also can remake this code, maybe create your own framework of this programm.

So, how does it work? 
Husky Browser has made by C#, WinForms .NET Framework. Packages, which I'm using for development:
1. CefShrap.WinForms https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp (for working with Browser)
2. Knapcode.TorSharp https://github.com/joelverhagen/TorSharp (for working with TOR)
3. MonoTorrenе https://github.com/alanmcgovern/monotorrent (for working with Torrents. P2P etc.)
4. MaterialSkin.2 https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin (for working with simple google-like design)
